Game of Life in NodeJS

Id reccomend not running this above 64x64... I have an RTX 2070 Super + Ryzen 7 2700 X... even so, it sucks beyond 75x75.

Such is the loss of making simulations in NodeJS / Electron of all things.

There are definitely better ways to do this, this is not one of them, I did this out of boredom.
